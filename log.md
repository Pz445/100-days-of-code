### Day 28

I went to a developer meeting today and picked up some nice nuggets from those with jobs in the industry.  One that I keep hearing over and over again is code everyday.  That's what is so lovely about the 100 Days of Code challenge!  I also completed the Javascript track on Free Code Camp

### Day 29

Today I installed React on my computer and started doing the tutorial tic-tac-toe game from the React website.

### Day 30

Today I did some more algorithms on Free Code Camp.  Although I already have the Javascript certificate, I had trouble with some algorithms and skipped them.  I also fiddled around with React and created a navbar.  I tested to see how CSS hierarchy worked in React and learned that child CSS will overwrite the Parent CSS.  I am excited to continue learning this framework and build some cool stuff.

### Day 31

Moving into the second third of the challenge and I found myself digging deeper into React.  I learned a bit about state, rendering, and JSX by starting the React course on Codecademy.
